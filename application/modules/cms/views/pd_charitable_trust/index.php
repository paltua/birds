                    <p>There are very few people who can continue with their childhood passion or dream! My affection
                        with this wonderful creation of god has started long back when I was in the age of 10.</p>
                    <p>I have devoted time, send money to continue it. Sometime I had to sacrifice new shirt in the
                        festive season to buy new cage for my love.</p>
                    <p>My journey of farming was started with local prison and Budgies, as and when I could manage some
                        fund from parent or from CCTV business, I have added different more spices in my farm. Once I
                        brought 2 African Grey Parrot. Those two lovely couple found my farm very homely and gave us 25
                        chicks. It made me crazier for birds. I started collecting more birds like Sunconure , Severe
                        Macaw etc. I started selling those chicks, and earned more money. I used that money to increase
                        my collection and enhance the farm capacity and atmosphere. This way my farm is very very
                        colorful now.</p>
                    <p>With the support from my spouse, parents, younger brother, other family member and friends, now I
                        am able to live with my passion.</p>
