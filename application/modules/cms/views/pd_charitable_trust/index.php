                    <p xss="removed"><b>My journey of farming</b> was started with local prison and Budgies, as and when
                        I could manage some fund from parent or from CCTV business, I have added different more spices
                        in my farm. Once I brought 2 African Grey Parrot. Those two lovely couple found my farm very
                        homely and gave us 25 chicks. It made me crazier for birds. I started collecting more birds like
                        Sunconure , Severe Macaw etc. I started selling those chicks, and earned more money. I used that
                        money to increase my collection and enhance the farm capacity and atmosphere. This way my farm
                        is very very colorful now.</p>
                    <p xss="removed">With the support from my spouse, parents, younger brother, other family member and
                        friends, now I am able to live with my passion.</p>
